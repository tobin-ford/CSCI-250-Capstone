    "Description: Our team plans collect biometric data from climbers during short climbs called boulders (10-20 feet in height). \n",
    "Data will be collected via accelerometers on each limb and center of mass, pressure sensors on the feet and flex sensors on each elbow. \n",
    "We will create visualzations of this data with respect to time and overlay it with video of the corresponding climb. \n",
    "This concept could be expanded upon by applying these sensors to different climbers to visualize the differences in technique between individuals \n",

    "- The video and plots of sensor data will help us understand the individual styles of climbers on the same boulders. This will highlight differences in techniques and skills. Climbing can often be unapproachable for non-climbers or begginers, this may help illustrate nuances of climbing that could be challening for outsiders to understand. The video in the background synced with a plot will be visually appealing and informative even if not technically useful in a coaching setting."
